I had access to the TI mini Dyno setup and did some experiments on it. I originally programmed/ simulated everything using Simulink. 
For this repository I want to program the hardware in C/C++ and do the simulations in Python, because they are free. 
Simulink is really good and I would prefer it since it is much easier, but I don't know if I will have Simulink in the future and would still like to be able 
to program the microcontroller.

# Hardware
- Launchxl-f28379d
- 2X BOOSTXL-drv8305, ( I could have used 2X BOOSTXL-3PHGANINV, but was worried about breaking it)
- 2MTR-DYNO
- LVSERVOMTR
